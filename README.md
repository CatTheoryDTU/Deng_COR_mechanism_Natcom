Repository containing the data, as well as, simulation and plotting routines to
investigate H coverage on Cu(100) and Cu(211) in the context of Deng et al.
*Add reference*

Each directory contains its own README file explaining how the figures of the
paper have been produced.

Python3 and CatMAP version 0.3.1 cloned from ```git@github.com:sringe/catmap-1.git``` are needed

I apologize for the ugly ```README```s in the gitlab online version. Note that all
```README```'s can be run via ```bash README```, in order to produce the respective
figures
